<font  size = "6"> Types of Tigers </font  size = "6">
<br>
<font color = "white" size = "5">There is actually only one tiger species, but each type of tiger is considered a subspecies. A subspecies is a group within a 
<br>
species that is either physically or genetically different from the rest. There are nine subspecies or types of tigers, three of which are now extinct. 
<br>
The remaining six subspecies include the Bengal, Indo-Chinese, South China, Amur,Malyan, and Sumatran tigers.

Sadly, tigers are on the brink of extinction. Just over a century ago, 100,000 wild tigers roamed across Asia. Today, fewer than 3,900 live 
<br>
in a mere four per cent of their historic range. The largest tiger population can now be found in India, home to half of all remaining 
<br>
wild tigers. Much of this decline has occurred in the past decade.

<br>
<font color = "white" size = "5">
The Govt. of India had launched “Project Tiger” on 1st April 1973 to promote conservation of the tiger. Project Tiger has been the largest 
<br>
species conservation initiative of its kind in the world. While the field implementation of the project, protection and management in the 
<br>
designated reserves is done by the project States, who also provide the matching grant to recurring items of expenditure, deploy field staff/officers
<br>
, and give their salaries, the Project Tiger Directorate of the Ministry of Environment and Forests was mandated with the task of providing 
<br>
technical guidance and funding support.
